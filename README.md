# discordBot
Running the bot on linux
1. download and run download.sh (this script will delete existing files, download, and extract the current repo)
2. run compile.sh
3. make token.txt file containing your bot user token
4. run run.sh with token file as the argument

## Notes
Bot must have a role above every member that it might want to change the role of (this can be done with a dummy role that adds no other permissions if wanted)
